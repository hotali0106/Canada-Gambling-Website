                1. The Casino is a member of the group of online Casinos proprietary to us (the "Group"). At any point in time the Group may offer Sign-Up Bonuses at any or all of its member Casinos.
                
                2. All new players have 7 days from the date their account was opened to claim their new player sign-up bonus. Thereafter the Sign-Up bonus will be unavailable. Subsequent promotions will be available to the player but the Sign-Up bonus will be considered forfeited.
                
                3. Please note that for the purposes hereof, a “Currency Unit” is a unit of the currency nominated by the Player at the time of his/her registration of his/her Real Account to be the currency to be utilized by such Player when transacting with the Casino.
                
                4. Where the Casino does not offer the primary Currency Unit in your country, you will be eligible to play and receive bonuses in any currency of your choosing.
                
                5. If you open multiple accounts you will not be eligible for the Sign-Up Bonus on each account. This and any other Sign-Up Bonus/es are only available once per Player and/or per environment where computers are shared and/or per email address. This offer is not transferable.
                
                6. Once you have received a Sign-Up Bonus at any of the Group's member Casinos, you are required that to meet additional minimum Play Through Requirements before you are eligible for additional Sign-Up Bonuses at any of the other member Casinos.
                
                7. The Bonus amount is subject to a minimum play through (wager) of 70 times (70x) by you before it can be transferred from your Bonus Balance to your Cash Balance ("Play Through Requirement"). For example, if you deposit 100 and receive a 100 credit bonus, the Play through Requirement will be 70 x 100 = 7000. Any winnings attributed to the Cash portion of your balance can be withdrawn at any time, subject to meeting all of these terms and conditions. In the event that a Player has a positive cash balance after the 70x wagering requirement is complete and such Player attempts to make a withdrawal, the withdrawal of winnings derived from the Free Spins will be capped at 100 Casino Credits (in the Player’s currency of play) and the remaining cash balance will be forfeited.
                
                8. If a Free Spins Offer is granted to you it must be played through 70 times (70x) before you will be able to withdraw any winnings made using the bonus money portion of your balance. ("Play through Requirement").
                
                9. You may thus not claim or receive a Free Spins offer at this Casino if you have previously claimed or received a Free Spins offer from another Group member Casino and have not yet wagered such previously claimed or received a Free Spins offer and its associated initial deposit at least 100 times at the Group member Casino that granted you such Free Spins offer. If your Account at this Casino has been credited with a Free Spins offer for which you (in our discretion, not to be exercised unreasonably) are ineligible, the Casino shall retrospectively void such Sign-Up Bonus and any winnings received by you after the Free Spins offer has been credited to your relevant accounts.
                
                10. Wagering on all games except Sic Bo, Craps, Baccarat, Casino War & Red Dog will count towards meeting the Play Through Requirement; however the percentage of the Sign-Up Bonus which may be wagered on certain games will vary as follows*:
                    
                    100% All Slots*(Excluding NetEnt slots & Progressive Jackpots), Keno & Scratch Card games (*Re-spin slot games counts 10%)
                    
                    50% NetEnt slot games

                    8% All table pokers, all roulettes, all video/power Pokers (excluding All Aces and Jacks or Better video pokers), all blackjacks (excluding Classic Blackjack) and Casino War

                    2% Classic Blackjacks, All Aces video pokers, all Jacks or Better video pokers

                    0% all baccarats, all craps, Red Dog, Sic Bo & Progressive Jackpots

                    If you play on the excluded games (0%) before meeting the playthrough requirements, then you agree that the casino holds the right to void any winnings made from these games at our discretion.

                    IMPORTANT: the contribution percentages and playthrough requirements may differ per promotion and/or geographical location. In this instance, the percentage amounts and playthrough requirements quoted in the promotion's Terms & Conditions will apply. Please always refer to the specific Terms & Conditions associated with each promotion to avoid any misunderstanding

                    * Please note that wagers placed using the gamble feature will not count towards the Play through Requirement.

                    ** Please note that all game play on MPV (Multi Player Tournaments), will not count towards the Play through Requirement.

                11. After fulfilling the total Play through Requirement on your first Sign-Up Bonus you can withdraw from your Cash Balance at any time.

                12. This bonus offer expires upon cashin. Any claim made to this bonus after a cashin has been requested, whether pending or paid, will render the bonus void. Where a Sign-Up Bonus has been granted to you, subject to you being required to have met all wagering requirements, you will be limited to a maximum withdrawal value of 6 times your first deposit amount and any remaining balance will be forfeited. This clause will only be applied at the discretion of casino management. All progressive wins are exempt from this clause.

                13. Should a withdrawal be submitted before the free Spins Bonus is credited to the Bonus Account, the bonus will be forfeited.

                14. You will be unable to withdraw any amount from your account until you've either met the wagering requirements or played through all funds in the Bonus Account. Winnings on bets from the Bonus Account, after the wagering requirements have been met, go straight to the Cash Account.

                15. If you do not want any Sign-Up Bonus which has been deposited into your account by the Casino then you are entitled to request that the Sign-Up Bonus be reversed out of your Casino account, subject to no Play Through having taken place on either the initial deposit or associated Sign-Up Bonus. You can do this by contacting Customer support by way of email or live chat, where after the Sign-Up Bonus reversal will take place. If any Play Through has taken place, then that Sign-Up Bonus may not be removed from your account (either by means of withdrawal or a request to the support staff) until the Play through Requirement associated with that Sign-Up Bonus has been met.

                16. Before any withdrawals are processed, your play will be reviewed for any irregular playing patterns e.g. playing of equal, zero margin bets or hedge betting, which all shall be considered irregular gaming for Sign-Up Bonus Play Through Requirement purposes. Other examples of irregular game play include but are not limited to, placing single bets equal to or in excess of 30% or more of the value of the bonus credited to your account until such time as the wagering requirements for that bonus have been met. The Casino reserves the right to decide in its sole discretion which activities constitute "irregular play" for Sign-Up Bonus Play through Requirement purposes from time-to-time and to withhold any withdrawals where irregular play has occurred to meet Sign-Up Bonus Play through Requirements.

                17. The maximum bet while a bonus is actively being played through is €8 per round and 50c per line. Failure to follow this condition may result in forfeiting any winnings.

                18. In the event that the Casino believes you are abusing or attempting to abuse a bonus or other promotion, or you are likely to benefit through abuse or lack of good faith from a gambling policy adopted by Us, the Casino Group may at its sole discretion, deny, withhold or withdraw from you any bonus or promotion, or rescind any policy either temporarily or permanently, or terminate your access to the Services and/or block your account. In such circumstances, the Casino shall be under no obligation to refund to you any funds that may be in your accounts other than your original deposit amounts.

                19. If the Sign-Up Bonus remains unused in your Bonus Balance for two (2) months or longer from the date the claim was made, the Sign-Up Bonus will be forfeited to the Casino.

                20. The Casino Rules, Terms and Conditions apply to this Promotion. In the event of a conflict between these Promotion-specific Rules, Terms and Conditions and the Casino Rules Terms and Conditions, the Promotion-specific Rules, Terms and Conditions shall prevail but only to the extent that the Rules, Terms and Conditions conflict with one another.
